# TP CSS Project 🎨

## Overview 🌐

This project, titled "TP CSS," is a simple web page showcasing a creative design implemented using HTML and CSS. The page consists of a central container (`outer`) with two rotating boxes (`box1` and `box2`) and a circular element (`box`) that rotates when hovered over. The design creates an engaging visual experience with smooth transitions and color combinations.

## Features 🚀

- **Rotating Boxes**: The project features two rectangular boxes (`box1` and `box2`) that rotate 90 degrees when the central container is hovered over. This rotation effect is achieved with smooth transitions, adding a dynamic visual element to the design.

- **Circular Element**: The circular element (`box`) in the center of the container also rotates 720 degrees when hovered over, creating an intriguing visual effect. The circular shape is achieved with border-radius, and the transition adds a playful touch to the design.

- **Styling**: The use of colors, borders, and transitions enhances the overall aesthetics of the page. The combination of background colors for the boxes (`box1` and `box2`) and the circular element creates a visually appealing composition.
